  All:"How many countries are there? is that it depends on who's doing the counting. The United Nations, for example, recognizes 251 countries and territories. The United States, however, officially recognizes fewer than 200 nations. Ultimately, the best answer is that there are 196 countries in the world." ,
  Europe:
    'Europe facts tell us there are 50 countries in Europe, including the world’s smallest country, Vatican City. The most visited countries in Europe are France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany.Europe is home to five transcontinental countries that straddle the border between Europe and Asia. These countries are Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey. It’s interesting to note that even though only part of Russia is on the European continent, it is still the largest country in Europe. Russia isn’t the only transcontinental country of note – Turkey happens to be the home of the largest European city, Istanbul.',
  'South America':
    'South America might not be the world’s largest continent (in fact, the 4th largest), but it sure has a lot to offer! From unique wildlife to diverse cultures, this vast landmass is also home to some of the most amazing wonders of the world—the mighty Amazon River, Machu Picchu, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, and the otherworldly Torres del Paine National Park. If you’re keen to find out more, we’re eager to share some of our interesting and fun facts about South America! However, South America spans 17,840,000 square kilometres and has a population of over 400 million, so there’s certainly a lot more you can find out about this fascinating part of the world! ',
  'North America':
    'When we think of the North American continent, we tend to think of its largest and most powerful country, the USA. One of the most surprising North America facts therefore is that there are actually 23 countries on the continent, along with dozens more territories and possessions. These include Canada, Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda and all of the Central American and Caribbean countries. By far the most populous of these countries is the USA, which in 2014 had an estimated population of 319.4 million. The second most populous country is Canada, with 35.5 million residents. Guatemala comes in third, with 15.8 million.',
  Africa:
    'Considered by many scientists to be the origin of mankind, Africa is a continent of 54 independent countries and a rich mix of native peoples, cultures, economies and history.The scenic beauty and variety is quite stunning, it is home to vast deserts, tropical rain forests, rugged mountains and fertile grasslands. It is abundant in flora and fauna unsurpassed by any other continent.An ever-increasing number of tourists from around the globe are drawn to this incredible continent every year to experience its wonders.Yet despite its natural wealth and beauty, Africa includes the fifteen least developed nations in the world, 70% of its population survives on less than $2 a day, disease and famine continue to kill millions of its people each year, and even the most basic education is denied to a large percentage of its children.',
  Oceania:
    "Oceania isn't a mythical underwater world like the lost city of Atlantis. Instead, it's a real place, resting in the immensity of the Pacific Ocean. If you've ever spent time in Australia or New Zealand, you were in Oceania, but that's just the beginning. This unimaginably vast region stretches on for many more miles, often just bits of dry land peeking out of the great blue ocean. Here are nine things to know about it.",
  Asia: 'Asia, the world’s largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern four-fifths of the giant Eurasian landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and the use of the term to describe such a vast area always carries the potential of obscuring the enormous diversity among the regions it encompasses. Asia has both the highest and the lowest points on the surface of Earth, has the longest coastline of any continent, is subject overall to the world’s widest climatic extremes, and, consequently, produces the most varied forms of vegetation and animal life on Earth. ',
  Antarctica:
    'Antarctica, the world’s southernmost and fifth largest continent. Its landmass is almost wholly covered by a vast ice sheet.Often described as a continent of superlatives, Antarctica is not only the world’s southernmost continent. It is also the world’s highest, driest, windiest, coldest, and iciest continent. Antarctica is about 5.5 million square miles (14.2 million square km) in size, and thick ice covers about 98 percent of the land. The continent is divided into East Antarctica (which is largely composed of a high ice-covered plateau) and West Antarctica (which is largely an ice sheet covering an archipelago of mountainous islands).',
